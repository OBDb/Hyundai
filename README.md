## About Hyundai

Hyundai Motor Company is a South Korean multinational automotive manufacturer headquartered in Seoul. Founded in 1967, Hyundai has grown to become one of the largest automobile manufacturers in the world.

## Generations

### Early Years (1967-1985)

Hyundai began as a construction company before entering the automotive industry. In 1967, the Hyundai Motor Company was established. The company's first model, the Hyundai Pony, was released in 1975 as the first mass-produced Korean car. This period was characterized by technology partnerships with Japanese and European manufacturers as Hyundai built its automotive expertise.

### Expansion Era (1986-1999)

During this period, Hyundai began expanding globally, entering the US market in 1986 with the Excel. Initially known for budget vehicles, Hyundai struggled with quality perception issues. By the late 1990s, the company introduced its revolutionary 10-year/100,000-mile warranty in the United States, signaling a commitment to quality improvement and customer confidence.

### Quality Revolution (2000-2010)

The early 2000s marked Hyundai's transformation from a budget brand to a respected automotive manufacturer. This era saw significant improvements in design, quality, and technology. The introduction of models like the Sonata and Santa Fe helped change consumer perception. In 2004, Hyundai ranked among the top manufacturers in initial quality studies, cementing its reputation turnaround.

### Global Premium Player (2011-Present)

In this current generation, Hyundai has positioned itself as a global competitor offering a full lineup from economy to luxury vehicles. The launch of the Genesis luxury brand in 2015 (which later became its own division) demonstrated Hyundai's upmarket ambitions. The company has become a leader in alternative fuel technologies with hybrid, plug-in hybrid, electric, and hydrogen fuel cell vehicles. Recent years have seen Hyundai expand into performance vehicles with its N brand and invest heavily in autonomous driving technology and mobility services.
